# TypeScript Source Conventions

- TypeScript strict mode is enabled. Never use `// @ts-ignore` or `as any`.
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions/intersections/mapped types.
- Use `readonly` on properties that should not be mutated after construction.
- All public methods must have explicit return types (no implicit inference across module boundaries).
- Use discriminated unions (literal `type` field) instead of type assertions or `instanceof` checks where possible.
- All custom errors extend `ProcurosError`. Use the 5-class hierarchy: ProcurosError, ProcurosApiError, ProcurosValidationError, ProcurosNetworkError, ProcurosTimeoutError.
- Prefer early returns over deeply nested conditionals.
- Use `async/await` over raw Promises. Use `AsyncGenerator` for pagination iterators.
- Import types with `import type { ... }` when the import is only used as a type.
- No default exports. Use named exports exclusively.
