# Procuros SDK Project Conventions

- Every hand-written file must stay under 500 lines. Split into logical modules if approaching the limit.
- Zero runtime dependencies. Use native `fetch` (Node 18+). No axios, node-fetch, etc.
- ESM-first (`"type": "module"` in package.json). Dual ESM + CJS build via tsup.
- Use barrel `index.ts` files for public re-exports. Internal modules import directly.
- PascalCase for types/interfaces/classes. camelCase for functions, variables, parameters.
- Never log, serialize, or include bearer tokens in error messages or stack traces.
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes. Use `type` for unions and aliases.
- All public API surfaces must have explicit return types.
- No commented-out code, no `console.log` in production code, no `TODO` without a tracked issue.
- Keep diffs minimal and focused. One concern per file.
